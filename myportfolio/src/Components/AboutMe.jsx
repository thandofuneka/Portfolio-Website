            <h1>About Me </h1>
            <p>Welcome! I am Thando Funeka, a dedicated and enthusiastic software developer with a strong academic background in Mathematics and Physical Sciences. 
               From achieving distinction in these subjects in matric to representing my country in an international mathematics competition, my journey has been 
               defined by a passion for problem-solving and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>  
               I am currently honing my skills in web development and have hands-on experience with technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. 
               Whether it is creating responsive landing pages or modular applications like Agile Board, I thrive on turning complex ideas into seamless user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>   
               My experience as an electoral officer and tutor has equipped me with leadership, teamwork, and communication skills, which I bring to every project.
               When I am not coding, you will find me exploring science fiction, analyzing data, or engaging in creative problem-solving challenges. I am excited about 
               opportunities to collaborate on impactful projects, where I can leverage my skills to create meaningful solutions.
